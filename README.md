- This project contains algorithms that do operations using traversals on Binary Trees.
- balanced() algorithm checks if the tree is balanced or not.
- floor(int x) algorithm returns the rightmost node with a key less than or equal to the input (x).
- keysAtDepth(int d) algorithm returns likend list that contains the keys at a given depth (d).
